      /><br /><br />The <em>blue footed booby</em> is awesome because
      <strong>of its silly, blue, webbed feet.</strong>.<br />The blue-footed
      booby is a marine bird native to subtropical and tropical regions of the
      eastern Pacific Ocean. It is one of six species of the genus Sula â€“ known
      as boobies. It is easily recognizable by its distinctive bright blue feet,
      which is a sexually selected trait and a product of their diet.
